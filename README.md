# Voice-chatbot V1.0

Speech recognized chatbot is a new venture to me to explore and this is the first voice chatbot developed by me with the most basic features and interactive conversation with the bot. I've used certain libraries and packages during the process of this development

The libraries used are **chatterbot, TKinter, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, webbrowser, threading**
Additonal libraries: Tensorflow 2, nltk, pyaudio 1.0.4/1.0.8 (don't do pip install directly from the server, rather, get the pyaudio '.whl', then, locate the folder location and then install it in the terminal),  

**EMPHASISING WORDS:**
  > Use _'wikipedia'_ to invoke the search on wikipedia
  > Use _'play'_ to invoke the search of youtube video
  > Use _'time'_ to invoke the current time
  > Use _'search'_ to invoke the search of query on google
  > Use _Instagram_ to invoke the instagram
 
 
instructions:
) Open _practice.py_ and run the code in text editor using terminal or perss the 'Run' icon (VS code in my case) **NOTE: Please ignore the file _main.py_ since it was the first file created during the starting time of this project**
2) Wait for few second or a minute until the GUI pops up.
3) Use mic to ask queries or can use keyboard to get the send the queries and the both will respond with both voice and well as text form.
4) Use 'emphasising' words to activate certain features in the program (They are listed aforementioned)

-Unfortunately, Couldn't able to store the queries due to some installation error with mysql 8.0 on my laptop. Will implement to store the state in the next version
-Note: Since the conversation were trained using chatterbot, the accuracy of learning is merely based on the data provided. Will explore more in this library for logic implementation for proper complex dialog flow. 

!!!!Please leave me a feedback!!!!
